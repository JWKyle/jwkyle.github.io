<h1>Gill the Betta</h1>
<p>Hello!  Welcome to my website.  My name is Gill.</p>

<p>I was once told that, as a fish, my memory only last up to about 3 seconds... but while that theory has been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1106884/Three-second-memory-myth-Fish-remember-months.html">debunked</a>, my memory isn't all that good.  So I figured "why not jot my notes down?"  Since pen and paper are not very conducive to my environment, I invested in a tiny bluetooth (or as we call it, deep-bluetooth)headset and am dictating this to my buddy's computer.</p>
<h2>My family</h2>
I'm very lucky to have such a nice family.  I have two very cool human roommates, named Julie and Jim.  I have one step-sister named Roxy, who's favorite activity is napping.

I also have one cousin, named Luke.  He's a sweet little guy who <strong>loves</strong> Pupperoni.

<h2>The typical day of Gill</h2>
<p>To be perfectly honest, my typical day is very relaxing. I typically wake up and have a few protein pellets, swim some laps, then take a nap.  It's a good life.  Sometimes I get a treat of bloodworms or mysis.  </p>
